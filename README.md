# E-commerce-Website-Development
E-commerce Website – A responsive full-stack online shopping platform featuring user authentication, product catalog, cart, checkout, payment integration, and an admin dashboard. Built using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with secure and scalable architecture

🛍️ E-commerce Website – Project Overview
🧠 Concept
The E-commerce Website project is a web-based application designed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience. It allows users to browse a catalog of products, manage their cart and wishlist, securely place orders, and track purchases. On the backend, it provides an admin interface for managing inventory, users, and orders.

This type of system is essential in today's digital economy, where online retailing plays a major role in business operations. The application demonstrates core principles of full-stack development, database management, authentication, and real-time transactions.
